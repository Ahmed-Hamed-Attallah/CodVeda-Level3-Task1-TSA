# Stock Price Forecasting with Time Series Models

## Project Overview
This project implements ARIMA and SARIMA models to forecast the closing price of YUM stock. It follows a complete time series analysis workflow: from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to model building, evaluation, and forecasting.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and prepares time series data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizes trends, volatility, and trading volume.
- **Time Series Decomposition**: Breaks down data into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
- **Modeling**: Implements ARIMA and SARIMA models for financial forecasting.
- **Evaluation**: Uses RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² metrics to validate model performance.

## Results
Successfully built a predictive framework capable of generating stock price forecasts, providing a foundation for quantitative financial analysis.


## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Statsmodels
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate exogenous variables (SARIMAX)
- Implement LSTM neural networks
- Develop a rolling forecast validation system
- Create a interactive dashboard
